# Expanding Card Project

This project showcases a set of cards that expand when hovered over, demonstrating the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive UI elements.
The cards will expand to reveal additional content upon hovering and will return to their original size when the hover is removed.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the expanding cards.
- `style.css`: The CSS file to style the cards, giving them animations and transitions.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file to handle interactions and animations for the expanding effect.
